## Project Goals

The bookrack app is a virtual bookshelf. It allows you organize and store books you have read in the past, and books
you would like to read in the future.

The backend was designed using [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

The frontend was designed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React.js](https://react.dev/).
